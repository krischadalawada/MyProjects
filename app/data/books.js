        "author": "Adrian Tchaikovsky",
        "description": "While (most of) the nonhuman creatures in these books are of terrestrial origin, their rise to intelligence follows a very different path than humanity. Reading these novels, you see the distant descendants of humanity confront these strange intelligences and come up against the ecosystems and technologies that have sprouted from those strange perspectives.",

        "description": "In Delta-V, an unpredictable billionaire recruits an adventurous cave diver to join the first-ever effort to mine an asteroid. The crew Hayabusa2 spacecraft has been exploring since June 2018. From the use of actual trajectories in space and scientific accuracy, to the title itself, Delta-v — the engineering term for exactly how much energy is expended performing a maneuver or reaching a target — Suarez pulls true-to-life details into describing the exciting and perilous mission. The reward for successful asteroid mining is incredible, but the cost could be devastating.",

        "author": "Mary Robinette Kowal",
        "description": "What if space exploration wasn not a choice but a necessity, driven by the knowledge that Earth would soon become uninhabitable and powered by international coalitions built after a catastrophic meteorite impact? That is the alternative history novelist Mary Robinette Kowal explores in her Lady Astronaut series. The books follow mathematician and World War II pilot Elma York, who dreams of becoming an astronaut herself. Kowal intricately melds real history with her fictional plot to create a series that is simultaneously hopeful and pragmatic. The Lady Astronaut offers a powerful vision of how spaceflight could be a positive force in society.",

        "description": "Red Moon, the latest novel from legendary science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson, blends realism and drama in a way that instantly transports the reader to the lunar surface. The book, which takes place 30 years into the future, opens on the journeys of Fred Fredericks, an American quantum engineer working for a Swiss company, and Ta Shu, a poet, feng shui expert and celebrity travel reporter to the moon where they are traveling to work. In the world of the book, China has become the first political and technological entity to inhabit the moon in a serious, long-term way.",

        "author": "Emma Newman",
        "description": "Before Mars sees a geologist arriving at a small Mars base after a lengthy journey only to realize that things are not as they seem. The base AI is untrustworthy, the psychologist seems sinister, and the main characters finds a note to herself she has no memory of writing. In a world of perfectly immersive virtual reality, can she trust what she sees? Or did the long trip take a toll on her sanity? Before Mars takes place on an eerie, largely empty Mars after a giant corporation buys the rights to the planet.",

        "author": "Andy Weir",
        "description": "In his second novel, Artemis, Andy Weir follows Jazz Bashara, a porter (and smuggler) on the moon who is drawn into a crime caper. Weir brings a similar meticulous detail to his descriptions of the moon as the ultimate tourist destination as he did to Watney misadventures on Mars, but his characterization of Jazz does not play to his writing strengths like Watney log entries did. Still, Artemis is an entertaining romp through a really intriguing future moon base, with plenty of one-sixth-gravity action and memorable twists. ",
